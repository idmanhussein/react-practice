# React Practice
A series of small projects to solidify my knowledge of React concepts.

# Context App
Here I practised using React Context. Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. Especially when working with a larger application, using props might get a little messy. I learnt that this is an alternative and cleaner way to structure my code. However, I also learnt to apply it sparingly because it makes component reuse more difficult.
